** Linked Lists using Dynamic allocation
In this code , I learned how to create and manipulate a linked list in C. 

I defined a 'Node' struct to represent each node in the list. 

I've practicted dynamic memory allocation using 'malloc' to create nodes.

I've learned how to initialize and link the nodes together to form a linked list.

And Last but not the least, I Implemeneted insertion and deletion operations on the linked list. 

For insertion, I've iterated through the list to find the correct position based on the value of the new node and inserted it while maintaining the list's order.

For deletion, I've iterated through the list to find the node with a specific value and removed it from the list, adjusting the pointers to maintain the integrity of the linked list.

Overall, I've gained a good understanding of how linked lists work and how to perform basic operations on them in C. 

** Linked Lists without Dynamic allocation 

During this Part I re-practiced The insertion into the list in numerical oder and deletion of nodes in linked lists, but I also worked with allocation using array to reserve memory for the nodes, constructed a linked list using the array and finally got introduced to __attribute__((packed)) the compiler specific attibute that can be applied to structs and classes to tell the compiler to pack the members of the struct/class together in contiguous location in memory.
